## Background

## Data Sources

## Reproducibility

This project uses the [`targets` package](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) for workflow management. Run `targets::tar_make()` from the console to run the workflow and reproduce all results. For more information, see the [targets_notes.md](targets_notes.md) file.

### Targets workflow:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

cat(
    "```mermaid",
    suppressMessages(targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = FALSE, )),
    "```",
    sep = "\n"
)
#this should display correctly on GitHub, or code can be pasted into https://mermaid.live
```
