The seven blocks along Keys Street in the extreme eastern section of teh area is not affected by many of the conditions set forth, and as it is zoned two-family residential, it probably in time will be entitled to a higher grade. The area as a whole contains many thrifty families and soundly improved prperties, and applications for loans should not be rejected without investigation.","15":"W.L. Atkinson, M. Arnerich, David T.
